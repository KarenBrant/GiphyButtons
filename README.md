# GiphyButtons
Program to show gifs about Superheroes. General Information: Developer - Karen Brant, Languages/Frameworks - HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Ajax, API.
Getting started: This program allows the user to click on a button to see 10 gifs about a particular Superhero. The gifs are not 
animated unless the user clicks on them.  The user can click again to deactivate them.  If the user would like to choose a 
different Superhero, one can be entered in the box on the page and the 'Add a Superhero' button can be clicked to create a new
button.  Then that button can be clicked to see the gifs for that Superhero.  Detailed instructions are given when the page
is opened.
